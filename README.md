The Docker Engine is a core component of Docker and plays a vital role in executing user commands. The main features of the Docker Engine are as follows:

+ Client-server architecture : When a user enters a command in Docker, it is transmitted to the Docker daemon (server) through the client and executed. This architecture is similar to the process in which a user issues a command to a computer.

+ Daemon Process : Responsible for creating and managing core objects in Docker. Without the Docker daemon, Docker itself cannot exist.

+ REST API :Provides a way for various applications to communicate with Docker. For example, this is the communication method used when another program asks Docker to run an image.

+ CLI (Command Line Interface) : A tool used by users to communicate with Docker. The CLI acts as a window for entering commands.

These components contribute to making Docker efficient and flexible. Thanks to the Docker engine, users can create and manage containers easily and quickly.
